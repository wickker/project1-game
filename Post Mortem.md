Approach and Process 

1. 
- Organise CSS more 
- Store text outputs on separate JS document 
- Dabble in CSS animation 
- Plan out more concretely the different game modes and write functions in such a way they can be repeated across different game modes

2. 
- Wire frames
- Note book
- Drawing 
- Write out in pseudo code what each function is supposed to achieved
- DOM GET variables allow for easy access
- Chained functions well 

Code and Design
1. 
- CSS
- Functions e.g. print and push array, init etc. 

2. 
- Simulations can go out and come back into the screen like snake
- Deep copy of arrays 
- Using objects and 2D arrays 


1.
- Drawing and planning 
- Time management
- Plan my functions for the day 
- Coffee
- Debugging "==="

2. 
- Still very hack and slash, especially CSS part 
- Ordering my functions
- Writing more comments 

3. 
- Course content is good
- Planned better, time-wise
- Use same TA/ instructor for soft launch and post mortem
